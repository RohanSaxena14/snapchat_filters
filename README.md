# snapchat_filters
Implementing fun snapchat_filters with the help of dlib facial_keypoint model.
Despite of being an easy project it is very much fun.
Firstly we have to be familier with facial_keypoints, that we will be using here,  (i am using a short mr bean's video clip for demostration here, Why?, well i guess because its fun)

## Facial_keypoints
Facial Keypoints are also called Facial Landmarks which generally specify the areas of the nose, eyes, mouth, etc on the face, classified by 68 key points, with coordinates (x, y), for that face. This is how it looks.
